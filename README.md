# 2024-Live-Election-Results
The 2016 election was filled with so much uncertainty from the Democratic party and Hillary Clinton frequently publicly calling the election a Russian collusion and rigged for Donald Trump. The 2020 election was filled with so much uncertainty from the Republican party and Donald Trump frequently publicly calling the election fraudulent and rigged. As result, there is often great division between people who believe in election integrity and people who do not. This is extremely frustrating, and I, an independent data scientist and investigator has decided to take matters into my own hands. There is very frequent live coverage of the election on TV, YouTube, Rumble, etc. that people like to tune into and see how it's going. There is also live coverage online with maps telling you how many votes each candidate has, who is leading, odds of winning, etc. For those that prefer to just see the numbers, you may tune into stuff like that.
