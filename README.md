# 2024-Live-Election-Results
The 2016 election was filled with so much uncertainty from the Democratic party and Hillary Clinton frequently publicly calling the election a Russian collusion and rigged for Donald Trump. The 2020 election was filled with so much uncertainty from the Republican party and Donald Trump frequently publicly calling the election fraudulent and rigged. As result, there is often great division between people who believe in election integrity and people who do not. This is extremely frustrating, and I, an independent data scientist and investigator has decided to take matters into my own hands. There is very frequent live coverage of the election on TV, YouTube, Rumble, etc. that people like to tune into and see how it's going. There is also live coverage online with maps telling you how many votes each candidate has, who is leading, odds of winning, etc. For those that prefer to just see the numbers, you may tune into stuff like that.\

That is where this project comes into play. One of the issues with investigating the results of elections is that everybody is just looking at the end result. Elections in America (as of recently) span over the course of 1-2 weeks. The first day has the most activity as day of voting is the busiest, and counting is the most prevalent. However, counting continues in some states for up to two weeks after election day. Therefore, the numbers will continue to tick up for both candidates in that time.
